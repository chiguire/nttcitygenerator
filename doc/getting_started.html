    <h1>Getting started with Octet</h1>
    <h2>Windows</h2>
    <p>On Windows, we can build with most flavours of visual studio, but I reccomend
    visual studio 2010 express as it is small and free</p>
    <p>The VC2010 directory contains a .sln file which you can click on.</p>
    <p>If this does not work with your version of visual studio, click on the .vcprojx
    file and it will create a solution.</p>
    <p>You can then build with ctrl-shift-B and run with F5.</p>
    <p>To build just the engine demo (animation) or the layer-1 samples (octet),
    right click on the solution explorer and select "build".</p>
    <h2>Mac OSX</h2>
    <p>On the Mac. Go into the xcode directory and clock on the xcode project.</p>
    <p>You may need to navigate to "product -> edit scheme -> run -> options" and
    select the xcode directory as the working directory. But I think this is now taken
    care of with an environment variable. (feedback, please).<p>
    <p>To build use (apple) B and use (apple) R to run.
    <h2>Project Layout</h2>
    <pre>
octet\assets                   images, sounds and meshes for projects
octet\doc                      this documentation
octet\external                 non-free assets and code
octet\lib                      libraries for OpenAL, OpenCL and OpenGL
octet\packaging                scripts for building distribution zip files
octet\src                      source code for the project
octet\webui                    web user interface for engine
octet\xcode                    Mac OSX build
octet\vc2010                   Visual studio build
    </pre>
    <p>The project is in two parts. The basic opengl part is for learning
    how to draw triangles and basic geometry. The engine part is a basic
    game engine with a scene, asset management and a myriad of other parts
    </p>
