NTT's City Generator
====================

This is a team project, made between December 2013 and June 2014. All geometry, except the models over the pavements, are generated procedurally. The generator includes a walkthrough mode, in which the camera steps through the streets of the city. It uses OpenGL for rendering, and employs the Octet framework.
