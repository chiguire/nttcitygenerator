Getting started:

Windows:

To build and run on windows you must install at least Visual
Studio Express 2010 C++ edition.

At present, you must download your Vendor's OpenCL implementation

AMD

NVidia
https://developer.nvidia.com/opencl

Intel

You may also need to install OpenAL

"oalinst" from
http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/Forms/AllItems.aspx

I may get the time to make this optional.


Xcode:

All libraries come as standard with Xcode, but you must use the
"Product -> Edit Scheme -> Options" dialogue to set the working directory
to the "xcode" folder in your project.
